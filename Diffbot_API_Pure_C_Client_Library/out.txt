{"icon":"http:\/\/allthingsd.com\/apple-touch-icon.png","text":"Google today formally launches some anticipated and previously glimpsed semantic features for its core English search engine on Google.com accessed through computers, phones and tablets.\nThis \u201CKnowledge Graph\u201D is a two-year-old project that evolved in part out of Google\u2019s acquisition of Metaweb in 2010 . Google now says it understands 500 million entities and 3.5 billion attributes and connections.\nWhen users search for a term that triggers the Knowledge Graph, they\u2019ll see a box of information on the right-hand side of the search results page.\nThe boxes contain all sorts of information that\u2019s specifically relevant to the search term. For instance, a results box for Leonardo da Vinci would have a brief description of him, his birth and death dates and his parents\u2019 names, pictures of five of his most famous works and links to other artists that people often search for when they\u2019re looking up da Vinci. It\u2019s a lot like a dense and visual Wikipedia page.\nWhen relevant, Google will ask users to specify what sort of entity they are looking for. So if you search for \u201Ckings,\u201D the box might include disambiguation links for the Los Angeles Kings of the NHL, the Sacramento Kings of the NBA and the NBC drama \u201CKings.\u201D\nWith all that information right there on the Google results page, users might be less likely to click through to other Web pages. I asked Google search engineer Ben Gomes about that, and he deflected the question.\n\u201COur goal is help you explore a topic more,\u201D Gomes said. \u201CWe\u2019re providing you with a skeleton which we\u2019re using to organize information. But if you actually want to find deep information around a topic, we have the Web pages to provide you with that information.\u201D\nAt least on an interface level, Microsoft is on a similar track with Bing \u2014 where it just launched custom panels for results in 150 categories .
